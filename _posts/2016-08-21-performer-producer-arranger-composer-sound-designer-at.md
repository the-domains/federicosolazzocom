  Performer, producer, arranger, composer, sound designer: at the moment, he’s
  playing along (as keyboardist, musical director and programmer) with Italian
  pop-star Alexia, whom he supported during her tours in Italy, China, Brazil,
  Finland, Estonia, Switzerland, Albania, Poland and Slovenia and with the band
  of the amazing Jamal Thomas (US, Maceo Parker’s drummer).He’s been endorsed by
  Nord Keyboards (Clavia DMI AB) since 2008 and since 2013 he’s also alpha/beta
  testing and sound designing for them. He moved to the Netherlands in 2011
  where he also had the opportunity to improve his sound designer skills by
  studying Sonology with Masters like Kees Tazelaar and Joel Ryan (San
  Francisco) at the Koninklijk Conservatorium in Den Haag and by meeting the
  modular synthesis guru Roland Kuit.On stage, he has played with many artists
  including Guthrie Govan (The Aristocrats), Stuart Hamm (Frank Gambale, Steve
  Vai, Joe Satriani), Daniele Gottardo, Mattias IA Eklundh (Freak Kitchen),
  Marco Sfogli (James LaBrie, Jordan Rudess, Virgil Donati), Atma Anur (Jason
  Becker, Richie Kotzen), Satindra Kalpoe (Anouk), Rik Mol (Metropole
  Orchestra), Shirma Rouse, Chiara Luppi (Cirque du Soleil), Leonardo Di Angilla
  (Mike Patton, Jovanotti), Flavio Scopaz (Eros Ramazzotti), Paolo Valli (Vasco
  Rossi, Laura Pausini, Claudio Baglioni), Davide Devito (Zucchero, Elisa) and
  many others. Other studio collaborations saw Federico playing and working on
  songs feat. Durga McBroom (Pink Floyd), Gavin Harrison (Porcupine Tree), Kevin
  Moore (Dream Theater), Göran Edman (Yngwie Malmsteen, John Norum) and many
  others.He had the pleasure to play in very prestigious venues including the
  San Siro stadium (Milan), the Blue Note club (Milan), St. Mark’s square
  (Venice) and at the Olympic Games (Beijing) and he can also count numerous
  television appearances on either Italian and international major networks such
  as RAI, Mediaset, RTL, MTV, Video Italia, RSI LA1. In the most important
  national festivals and events he shared the same stage with Laura Pausini,
  Claudio Baglioni, Giorgia, Elisa, Gianna Nannini, Lucio Dalla, Spagna, Albano,
  Francesco Renga, Gigi D’Alessio, Anna Tatangelo, Mario Biondi, Irene Grandi,
  Fiorella Mannoia and many others (Amiche per l’abruzzo, Festivalshow, Battiti
  live, O’Scia’, Radio Company, Venice Music Awards, Sanremo and more).You can
  find my full CV here.Federico loves good beers (especially M’anis and Kwak),
  his favourites books are “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” by L. Carroll,
  “Notes from Underground” by F. Dostoyevsky and “The Art of Being Happy” by A.
  Schopenhauer.
